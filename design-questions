Do we allow states to have names?

What order do we give the fields of the Fst type? What order do we give the
arguments of add_arc?

Should transitions take the form of a 4 dimensional array?

Do we need to create a dictionary to map state names, inputs and outputs into
indices for lookup in the transitions matrix, or can we just lookup the index
each time?

How do we make good unit tests for this?

What functionality are we aiming for? Design with that in mind.
